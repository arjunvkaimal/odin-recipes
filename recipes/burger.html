    <p>hamburger, or simply a burger, is a dish consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll.  </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>

    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>

        <li>Whisk balsamic vinegar, oil, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Pour over tomato slices to marinate.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 5 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Top each burger with mozzarella cheese; allow to melt. Serve on hamburger buns with marinated tomato slices.
